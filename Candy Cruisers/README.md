# Candy Cruisers

## About
Welcome to Candy Cruisers, a top-down retro space shooter remixed with color-matching puzzle elements!

## How to play
To play, fire up the demo in the main repo folder. The rules are simple: blast all the aliens before
they reach the bottom of the screen. 

## Controls
Left and right arrow keys move your triangle and spacebar shoots. P to pause.
Beyond that, it's up to you to figure it out. I believe in you!

## Requirements
You can play the DEMO on Max, Linux and Windows. 

To check out the project, make sure you have 
Unity 2022.3.9f1 installed.
